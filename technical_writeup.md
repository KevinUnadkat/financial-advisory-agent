# Technical Write-Up: Financial Advisory Agent  

## 1. Architecture Decisions   

### **Key Components:**  
- **Knowledge Base (`concepts.json`)**: A structured JSON file that stores essential financial concepts, regulations, and best practices.  
- **Retrieval System**: A **custom search algorithm** retrieves relevant financial knowledge based on user queries.  
- **LLM Integration**: The system uses **Gemini-2.0 AI** (via `langchain_google_genai`) for generating human-like responses.  
- **Conversation Memory**: Implements **LangChain’s `ConversationBufferMemory`** to maintain session context, improving user experience in interactive conversations.  
- **Guardrails & Validation**: Ensures that financial guidance remains **accurate, ethical, and safe** by filtering misleading terms and adding disclaimers.  

## 2. Safety Measures Implemented  

Ensuring ethical, transparent, and responsible AI-driven financial guidance is a key focus of this system.  

### **Guardrails & Compliance:**  
✅ **Restricted Terms Filtering**: Blocks responses containing misleading terms such as:  
   - “Guaranteed returns”  
   - “Sure profit”  
   - “Insider trading”  

✅ **Ethical Financial Guidance**: AI is **restricted from making speculative claims** or providing personalized investment advice.  

✅ **Response Validation**:  
   - **Numerical Data Validation**: Ensures numbers are well-formatted and properly contextualized.  
   - **Disclaimer Enforcement**: Adds a legal disclaimer to every response to clarify that this is **general financial information, not investment advice**.  

✅ **Structured Output Format**: Responses follow a **clear, structured format** to improve readability:  
   - Short, concise paragraphs  
   - Bullet points for lists  
   - No redundant information  

## 3. Potential Improvements  

Although the current system provides **basic financial guidance**, several enhancements can improve accuracy, usability, and efficiency:  

🔹 **Enhanced Retrieval Mechanism (RAG)**  
- Implement **vector-based search** (FAISS or ChromaDB) to improve the accuracy of retrieving financial knowledge.  

🔹 **Real-Time Financial Data Integration**  
- Use **APIs (Yahoo Finance, Alpha Vantage, etc.)** to fetch live market data for **stocks, bonds, and crypto prices**.  

🔹 **User Personalization**  
- Adapt responses based on **user risk profile** (e.g., conservative, aggressive investors).  

🔹 **Multi-Language Support**  
- Expand support for **regional languages** for better accessibility.  

## 4. Challenges Faced  

### **Ensuring AI Accuracy**  
- Preventing **AI hallucinations** (incorrect information) by **strictly restricting** responses to the knowledge base.  
- Improving retrieval accuracy while keeping the system **efficient**.  

### **Balancing Conciseness & Depth**  
- Financial guidance must be **detailed yet not overwhelming**.  
- The prompt was fine-tuned to **keep responses structured, clear, and to the point**.
